/*
 * Dispatch Group State:
 *
 * Generation (32 - 63):
 *   32 bit counter that is incremented each time the group value reaaches
 *   0 after a dispatch_group_leave. This 32bit word is used to block waiters
 *   (threads in dispatch_group_wait) in _dispatch_wait_on_address() until the
 *   generation changes.
 *
 * Value (2 - 31):
 *   30 bit value counter of the number of times the group was entered.
 *   dispatch_group_enter counts downward on 32bits, and dispatch_group_leave
 *   upward on 64bits, which causes the generation to bump each time the value
 *   reaches 0 again due to carry propagation.
 *
 * Has Notifs (1):
 *   This bit is set when the list of notifications on the group becomes non
 *   empty. It is also used as a lock as the thread that successfuly clears this
 *   bit is the thread responsible for firing the notifications.
 *
 * Has Waiters (0):
 *   This bit is set when there are waiters (threads in dispatch_group_wait)
 *   that need to be woken up the next time the value reaches 0. Waiters take
 *   a snapshot of the generation before waiting and will wait for the
 *   generation to change before they return.
